# discord-theme
Discord themer that will patch custom css and insert javascript into Discord. 

## Replacing Discord's New Theme With the Old One
The themer contains a copy of the old.css file and can patch Discord's theme back to the old color palette by default

It currently changes
- Clyde svg is back to the normal clyde
- Horrible blue highlight color changed back to nice blurple like it was before
- Reactions have been squarified after being more circularized 
- Mentions have been reverted from the white background to the normal blue
- Button colors have been reverted
- Greens are more muted again after being brightened in the update
- Reds have also been muted more

If you find anything that this misses, please open an issue describing what needs to be changed
